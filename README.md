- Make build system

## 🔧 Installation

### Option 1: Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LulzSec6824/StaticServer.git
cd StaticServer

# Build the optimized release version
make release

# Alternatively, build with debug symbols
make debug
```

### Option 2: Download Binary Release

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/LulzSec6824/StaticServer/releases) to download pre-compiled binaries for your platform.

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

After building the project, you can start the server immediately:

```bash
# Start with default settings (port 8080, serving from ./public)
./static_server

# Start on custom port
./static_server 3000

# Start on custom port with custom directory
./static_server 3000 /path/to/web/files
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

## 💻 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

Start the server and serve the default content:

```bash
./static_server
```

### Custom Port and Directory

```bash
./static_server 3000 /var/www/html
```

### Running in Background

```bash
./static_server 8080 ./public > server.log 2>&1 &
```

### Testing with cURL

```bash
# Test the server's response
curl -I http://localhost:8080/

# Download a file
curl -O http://localhost:8080/path/to/file.txt
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `port` | Server listening port | 8080 |
| `root_dir` | Directory to serve files from | ./public |

### Advanced Configuration (Planned)

Future releases will support additional configuration options through:
- Configuration files (JSON format)
- Environment variables
- Extended runtime options

## 📊 Performance

StaticServer is designed for high performance with low resource usage:

- **Memory Usage**: < 5MB for basic operation
- **Concurrent Connections**: Tested with 1000+ simultaneous connections
- **Throughput**: 10,000+ requests per second on modest hardware

### Benchmark Results

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Average Response Time | 2.3ms |
| Requests per Second | 12,450 |
| 99th Percentile Latency | 12ms |
| Max Memory Usage | 4.8MB |

## 🧪 Testing

StaticServer includes comprehensive tests to ensure reliability:

```bash
# Run all tests
make tests

# Run specific test suites
make test_config
make test_file_utils
make test_server
make test_integration
```

## 📝 Documentation

### API Documentation

If you want to use StaticServer as a library in your own C++ project, you can include the necessary headers:

```cpp
#include "include/server.h"
#include "include/config.h"

int main() {
    // Create a custom server configuration
    ServerConfig config;
    config.port = 8080;
    config.root_directory = "./web_files";
    
    // Initialize and start the server
    StaticFileServer server(config);
    server.start();
    
    return 0;
}
```

> **Note:** When using StaticServer in your project, you must comply with the terms of the GNU General Public License v3.0, which requires derivative works to also be licensed under the GPLv3.

### Future Configuration Options (Planned)

```cpp
// These options are planned for future releases
ServerConfig config;
config.port = 8080;
config.root_directory = "./public";
config.index_files = {"index.html", "index.htm", "default.html"}; // Planned feature
config.enable_caching = true; // Planned feature
config.cache_control_max_age = 3600; // 1 hour - Planned feature
config.log_level = LogLevel::Debug; // Planned feature
```

## 🔄 Build Options

The Makefile supports various build targets:

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make release` | Build optimized version for production |
| `make debug` | Build with debug symbols |
| `make tests` | Build and run all tests |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts |
| `make run` | Build and run the server |
| `make help` | Display all available targets |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server Won't Start

```
ERROR: Could not bind to port 8080
```

This usually means the port is already in use. Try a different port:

```bash
./static_server 3000
```

#### Files Not Found

Ensure you're serving files from the correct directory:

```bash
./static_server 8080 /full/path/to/files
```

#### Permissions Issues

Make sure the server has read access to the files you're trying to serve:

```bash
chmod -R +r /path/to/web/files
```
