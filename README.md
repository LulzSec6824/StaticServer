## 🔧 Installation

### Option 1: Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/StaticServer.git
cd StaticServer

# Build the optimized release version
make release

# Alternatively, build with debug symbols
make debug
```

### Option 2: Download Binary Release

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/username/StaticServer/releases) to download pre-compiled binaries for your platform.

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

After building the project, you can start the server immediately:

```bash
# Start with default settings (port 8080, serving from ./public)
./static_server

# Start on custom port
./static_server 3000

# Start on custom port with custom directory
./static_server 3000 /path/to/web/files
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

## 💻 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

Start the server and serve the default content:

```bash
./static_server
```

### Custom Port and Directory

```bash
./static_server 3000 /var/www/html
```

### Running in Background

```bash
./static_server 8080 ./public > server.log 2>&1 &
```

### Testing with cURL

```bash
# Test the server's response
curl -I http://localhost:8080/

# Download a file
curl -O http://localhost:8080/path/to/file.txt
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `port` | Server listening port | 8080 |
| `root_dir` | Directory to serve files from | ./public |

### Configuration File (Optional)

Create a `config.json` file in the same directory as the executable:

```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "root_directory": "./public",
  "index_files": ["index.html", "index.htm"],
  "cache_control": true,
  "cache_max_age": 3600,
  "log_level": "info"
}
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure the server using environment variables:

```bash
# Set custom port
export STATIC_SERVER_PORT=3000

# Set custom root directory
export STATIC_SERVER_ROOT="/var/www/html"

# Start the server with these settings
./static_server
```

```

## 📝 Documentation

### API Documentation

If you want to use StaticServer as a library in your own C++ project, you can include the necessary headers:

```cpp
#include "include/server.h"

int main() {
    // Create a custom server configuration
    Configuration config;
    config.port = 8080;
    config.rootDirectory = "./web_files";
    
    // Initialize and start the server
    Server server(config);
    server.start();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Advanced Configuration Options

For more advanced usage, you can customize the server behavior:

```cpp
Configuration config;
config.port = 8080;
config.rootDirectory = "./public";
config.indexFiles = {"index.html", "index.htm", "default.html"};
config.enableCaching = true;
config.cacheControlMaxAge = 3600; // 1 hour
config.logLevel = LogLevel::Debug;

Server server(config);
server.start();
```

## 🔄 Build Options

The Makefile supports various build targets:

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make release` | Build optimized version for production |
| `make debug` | Build with debug symbols |
| `make tests` | Build and run all tests |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts |
| `make run` | Build and run the server |
| `make help` | Display all available targets |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server Won't Start

```
ERROR: Could not bind to port 8080
```

This usually means the port is already in use. Try a different port:

```bash
./static_server 3000
```

#### Files Not Found

Ensure you're serving files from the correct directory:

```bash
./static_server 8080 /full/path/to/files
```

#### Permissions Issues

Make sure the server has read access to the files you're trying to serve:

```bash
chmod -R +r /path/to/web/files
```
